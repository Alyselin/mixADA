Description: Graphical user interface to perform normalization, fitting of a mixed effects mixture model
 and computation of percentiles or prediction limits with application to estimate cut points for samples exhibiting anti drug antibody reactions.
 Currently, two different user interfaces are available: mixADAserver() implements the complete process for raw data, mixADAsimple() implements only mixture model fits,
 SCP and CCP computation for data sets that have already been normalized.
